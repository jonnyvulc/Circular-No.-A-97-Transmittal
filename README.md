This Transmittal Memorandum revises Circular No. A-97, "Rules and regulations permitting Federal agencies to provide specialized or technical services to State and local units of government under Title III of the Intergovernmental and Cooperation Act of 1968," by rescinding paragraph 8, Reports to Congress. The Congressional reporting requirement referenced in paragraph 8 of the Circular was mandated under Section 304 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968. Section 304 was repealed by the Congressional Reports Elimination Act of 1980. The reports to the Congress are no longer required by statute or by the Circular.
